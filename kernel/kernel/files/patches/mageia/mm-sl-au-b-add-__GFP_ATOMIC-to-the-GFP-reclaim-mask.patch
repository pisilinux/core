Subject: [PATCH] mm, sl[au]b: add __GFP_ATOMIC to the GFP reclaim mask

Commit d0164adc89f6 ("mm, page_alloc: distinguish between being unable
to sleep, unwilling to sleep and avoiding waking kswapd") modified
__GFP_WAIT to explicitly identify the difference between atomic callers
and those that were unwilling to sleep.  Later the definition was
removed entirely.

The GFP_RECLAIM_MASK is the set of flags that affect watermark checking
and reclaim behaviour but __GFP_ATOMIC was never added.  Without it,
atomic users of the slab allocator strip the __GFP_ATOMIC flag and
cannot access the page allocator atomic reserves.  This patch addresses
the problem.

The user-visible impact depends on the workload but potentially atomic
allocations unnecessarily fail without this path.
